This is a more advanced C2 with the ability to connect to multiple different IP addresses and execute commands on them one-at-a-time. 
The way you can change from one IP address to another is by inputting 'quit' on the client-side when it says: "Enter command you would like to send:". 

There still needs to be piping implemented.
