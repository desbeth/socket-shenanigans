Using the server.c (now server.c) as a listener and client.c (now attacker.c) as the attacker, 
you're able to execute commands onto the listener, and receive the output back on the attacker. 

Also, you're able to use piping when entering commands now! 

The upcoming projects will (hopefully) focusing on grouping the IP addresses to be able to send the commands to a group and also 
have the listener disguised as the bash shell!
