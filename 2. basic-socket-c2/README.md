This is a basic C2, where you execute server.c as a listener, and then you execute client.c (both on Linux distributions). 
From client.c, you can send commands and receive the output from the command on the server.c terminal onto the client.c terminal.

This does not allow for commands which utilize piping (yet!, will be in project 3).
